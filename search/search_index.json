It is calculated for all frames in the trajectory. The RMSD for frame x is: where N is the number of atoms in the atom selection; tref is the reference time, (typically the first frame is used as the reference and it is regarded as time t=0); and r' is the position of the selected atoms in frame x after superimposing on the reference frame, where frame x is recorded at time tx. The procedure is repeated for every frame in the simulation trajectory. \u25cf Protein RMSD : The plot shows the RMSD evolution of a protein (left Y-axis). All protein frames are first aligned on the reference frame backbone, and then the RMSD is calculated based on the atom selection. Monitoring the RMSD of the protein can give insights into its structural conformation throughout the simulation. RMSD analysis can indicate if the simulation has equilibrated \u2014 its fluctuations towards the end of the simulation are around some thermal average structure. Changes of the order of 1-3 \u00c5 are perfectly acceptable for small, globular proteins. Changes much larger than that, however, indicate that the protein is undergoing a large conformational change during the simulation. It is also important that your simulation converges \u2014 the RMSD values stabilize around a fixed value. If the RMSD of the protein is still increasing or decreasing on average at the end of the simulation, then your system has not equilibrated, and your simulation may not be long enough for rigorous analysis. \u25cf Ligand RMSD : Ligand RMSD (right Y-axis) indicates how stable the ligand is with respect to the protein and its binding pocket. In the above plot, 'Lig fit Prot' shows the RMSD of a ligand when the protein-ligand complex is first aligned on the protein backbone of the reference and then the RMSD of the ligand heavy atoms is measured. If the values observed are significantly larger than the RMSD of the protein, then it is likely that the ligand has diffused away from its initial binding site. 'Lig fit Lig' shows the RMSD of a ligand that is aligned and measured just on its reference conformation. This RMSD value measures the internal fluctuations of the ligand atoms. \u25cf The Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) is useful for characterizing local changes along the protein chain. The RMSF for residue i is: where T is the trajectory time over which the RMSF is calculated, tref is the reference time, ri is the position of residue i; r' is the position of atoms in residue i after superposition on the reference, and the angle brackets indicate that the average of the square distance is taken over the selection of atoms in the residue. On this plot, peaks indicate areas of the protein that fluctuate the most during the simulation. Typically you will observe that the tails (N- and C-terminal) fluctuate more than any other part of the protein. Secondary structure elements like alpha helices and beta strands are usually more rigid than the unstructured part of the protein, and thus fluctuate less than the loop regions. \u25cf B factors : The RMSF of the protein can also be correlated with the experimental x-ray B-factor (right Y-axis).Due to the difference between the RMSF and B-factor definitions, one-to-one correspondence should not be expected. However, the simulation results should parallel the crystallographic data \u25cf The Ligand Root Mean Square Fluctuation (L-RMSF) is useful for characterizing changes in the ligand atom positions. The RMSF for atom i is: where T is the trajectory time over which the RMSF is calculated, tref is the reference time (usually for the first frame, and is regarded as the zero of time); r is the position of atom i in the reference at time tref, and r' is the position of atom i at time t after superposition on the reference frame. Ligand RMSF shows the ligand's fluctuations broken down by atom, corresponding to the 2D structure in the top panel. The ligand RMSF may give you insights on how ligand fragments interact with the protein and their entropic role in the binding event. In the bottom panel, the 'Fit Ligand on Protein' line shows the ligand fluctuations, with respect to the protein. The protein-ligand complex is first aligned on the protein backbone and then the ligand RMSF is measured on the ligand heavy atoms. 'Ligand' line shows fluctuations where the ligand in each frame is aligned on the ligand in the reference frame, and its fluctuations are measured for the ligand heavy atoms. These RMSF values reflect the internal atom fluctuations of the ligand. Protein interactions with the ligand can be monitored throughout the simulation. These interactions can be categorized by type and summarized, as shown in the plot above. Protein-ligand interactions (or 'contacts') are categorized into four types : Hydrogen Bonds, Hydrophobic, Ionic and Water Bridges. Each interaction type contains more specific subtypes, which can be explored through the 'Simulation Interactions Diagram' panel. The stacked bar charts are normalized over the course of the trajectory: for example, a value of 0.7 suggests that 70% of the simulation time the specific interaction is maintained. Values over 1.0 are possible as some protein residue may make multiple contacts of same subtype with the ligand. Hydrogen Bonds: (H-bonds) play a significant role in ligand binding. Consideration of hydrogen-bonding properties in drug design is important because of their strong influence on drug specificity, metabolization and adsorption. Hydrogen bonds between a protein and a ligand can be further broken down into four subtypes: backbone acceptor; backbone donor; side-chain acceptor; side-chain donor. The current geometric criteria for protein-ligand H-bond is: distance of 2.5 \u00c5 between the donor and acceptor atoms (D\u2014H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A); a donor angle of \u00b3120\u00b0 between the donor-hydrogen-acceptor atoms (D\u2014H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A); and an acceptor angle of \u00b390\u00b0 between the hydrogen-acceptor-bonded_atom atoms (H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A\u2014X). Hydrophobic contacts: fall into three subtypes: p-Cation; p-p; and Other, non-specific interactions. Generally these type of interactions involve a hydrophobic amino acid and an aromatic or aliphatic group on the ligand, but we have extended this category to also include p-Cation interactions. The current geometric criteria for hydrophobic interactions is as follows: p-Cation \u2014 Aromatic and charged groups within 4.5 \u00c5; p-p \u2014 Two aromatic groups stacked face-to-face or face-to-edge; Other \u2014 A non-specific hydrophobic sidechain within 3.6 \u00c5 of a ligand's aromatic or aliphatic carbons. Ionic interactions: or polar interactions, are between two oppositely charged atoms that are within 3.7 \u00c5 of each other and do not involve a hydrogen bond. We also monitor Protein-Metal-Ligand interactions, which are defined by a metal ion coordinated within 3.4 \u00c5 of protein's and ligand's heavy atoms (except carbon). All ionic interactions are broken down into two subtypes: those mediated by a protein backbone or side chains. Water Bridges: are hydrogen-bonded protein-ligand interactions mediated by a water molecule. The hydrogen-bond geometry is slightly relaxed from the standard H-bond definition. The current geometric criteria for a protein-water or water-ligand H-bond are: a distance of 2.8 \u00c5 between the donor and acceptor atoms (D\u2014H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A); a donor angle of \u00b3110\u00b0 between the donor-hydrogen-acceptor atoms (D\u2014H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A); and an acceptor angle of \u00b390\u00b0 between the hydrogen-acceptor-bonded_atom atoms (H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7A\u2014X). UFF energy minimization - UFF (Universal Force Field) is capable of reproducing the most structural feature across the periodic table. This force field can optimize the geometry for all elements, and does well with inorganic materials, and organometallic materials. DDG - DDG stands for delta delta G or change in change of gibbs free energy, which is a marker of how much the binding efficiency is increased by a particular change in terms of exergonic reactions (reactions which possess change in Gibb\u2019s free energy as a negative value) CUPSAT is a tool to predict changes in protein stability upon point mutations. The prediction model uses amino acid-atom potentials and torsion angle distribution to assess the amino acid environment of the mutation site. Additionally, the prediction model can distinguish the amino acid environment using its solvent accessibility and secondary structure specificity. HotSpot Wizard 3 is a web server for an automated design of mutations and smart libraries for the engineering of protein function and stability and the annotation of protein structures. The identification of mutagenesis hot spots is based on the integration of structural, functional and evolutionary information obtained from several bioinformatics databases and computational tools. Users can explore hot spots identified by four different protein engineering strategies: (i) functional hot spots represented by highly mutable residues located in the catalytic pocket and/or access tunnels, (ii) stability hot spots (structural flexibility approach) represented by flexible residues, (iii) stability hot spots (sequence consensus approach) represented by positions which are frequently occupied by the same residue in sequence homologs, and (iv) correlated hot spots represented by pairs of coevolving residues that modulate enzyme activity and selectivity. For each of these strategies, HotSpot Wizard lists residues ordered by their predicted suitability for mutagenesis together with relevant analysis-specific information and filters enabling users to reduce the set of identified hot spots to only the most promising candidates or to select hot spots based on their criteria. Detailed annotations of each position include also amino acid frequencies in sequence homologs and predicted tolerated amino acids that can be used to select suitable substitutions for individual hot spots and design appropriate degenerate codons directly through the HotSpot Wizard interface. Hot spots, as well as any other residues, can be visualized in the structure together with identified pockets and tunnels to explore their structural context.","title":"Supplementary information"},{"location":"project/discussion/","text":"Laccase enzymes are a type of multi-copper species, which catalyze the oxidation of substrate molecules to corresponding reactive radicals with the simultaneous reduction of oxygen to water at a mononuclear copper center type-1(T1). The catalytic center of these enzymes is composed of four copper atoms. Two histidine residues and one cysteine residue create a metallo-organic link with the T1 copper atom. Additionally, the T1 copper is in close proximity to the side chains of a methionine, leucine, or isoleucine. Two histidine ligands coordinate the trinuclear center's type 2 (T2) copper atom, whereas a total of six histidine ligands coordinate the two types 3 (T3) copper atoms. The enzyme can oxidize a variety of substances, including polyphenols, methoxy substituted phenols, aromatic diamines, and others. Laccase enzymes are used in a variety of biotechnological processes, such as the delignification of lignocellulosic materials, bio-pulping and bio-bleaching, transformation of textile dyes, removal of phenolics from must and wine, and detoxification of effluent containing phenolic waste. An explicit description of the molecular determinants of their substrate specificity are yet to be deciphered. Considerable number of crystal structures of fungal laccases have already been determined, hence providing us with a diversity of templates for further study of the molecular interaction between the enzyme and its substrates. The affinity of laccase toward AFB1 and AFG1 depends on the ability of the enzyme to form hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, water bridges and hydrophobic contacts with the two toxin variants of Aflatoxin. In the current study, We have performed docking studies of the wild-type (WT) laccases to establish base levels of binding affinity of AFB1 and AFG1, while simultaneously trying to establish if laccases possess the affinity to bind and subsequently degrade different variants of Aflatoxins. Favorable mutations were found using critical interacting residues in the WT molecular docking, using CUPSAT server and HotSpot Wizard. Twenty favorable and stabilizing point mutations found were individually introduced to the laccase enzyme and the impact was tested using molecular docking. From the results generated, 4 best results were filtered and their stacking effect was tested using a multiple mutation approach. The results were not as beneficial as individual mutations. Only two best point mutations were selected namely 106_asp-lys and 181_asp-trp. These were further tested using Molecular Dynamics approach to prove stabilities of their protein-ligand complexes in a water-based system and simultaneously validate our molecular docking results. The 181_asp-trp_afb complex, when compared to the wt-laccase_afb1 complex, was found to possess stronger protein-ligand interactions, and stable structural conformations deduced from reduced RMSF and RMSD values. 106_asp-lys_afg1 complex when compared to wt-laccase-afg1 complex showed an improved protein-ligand interaction despite having a slight increase in protein RMSD values. All experimentation was conducted in a dry lab and further requires wet-lab testing to fortify our findings. The applications of the laccase degradation activity lies towards having safer food work and also works under the Goal 2 -> 0 Hunger and Goal 3 -> Good Health and Well Being of the Sustainable Development Goals.

The comparison to binding energy of NE (-4.6 kcal/mol) (Nonaethylene Glycol) helped provide a comparison state of binding energy in the analysis. Laccase (WT) with NE Laccase (WT) with AFB1 Laccase (WT) with AFG1 Creation of mutants from predictions from HotSpot Wizard and CUPSAT using PyMOL Total 14 residues were generated from HotSpot wizard of whom point mutations were checked to be stabilizing or destabilizing at stability and functional hotspots. Out of those 14 only 8 of the residues had favorable point mutations and the most stabilizing mutations were introduced in the laccase enzyme (point mutations) and molecular docking was reperformed for each mutant to check for impact. From CUPSAT the entire list of impact of point mutation on stability for each residue in the structure of laccase provided to the server was checked and top 10 results based on maximum Delta Delta G (DDG) energy were taken to be introduced to laccase and subsequently molecular docking was performed to see the impact of these point mutations on binding energy of laccase to both variants of Aflatoxin. None of the residues with histidine changes were taken from either servers for mutation due to critical function of histidine in the enzyme structure for interacting with the essential 4 copper ions in the functional enzyme. HotSpot Wizard Server Predictions CUPSAT Server Predictions DDG (Delta Delta Gibbs Free Energy)values indicate the increase in stability after making the point mutation. Data Analysis and sorting to reveal most beneficial mutants based on molecular docking results All binding energy results obtained from docking the 20 point mutation mutants of laccase we tested were placed in a common excel file and sorted to reveal the mutants with highest binding energy for each of the toxins. Top 4 results were filtered out and when compared with docking results of the Wild-type laccase enzyme to reveal that mutation at 480 Met position to Val yielded significant bump in binding energy of AFG1, mutation at 182 Glu position to Tyr yielded significant bump in binding energy of AFG1, mutation at 181 Asp position to Trp yielded significant bump in binding energy of AFB1, and mutation at 106 Asp position to Lys yielded significant bump in binding energy of AFG1. Maximum bumps in binding energy were observed in 106_asp-lys mutation for AFG1 and 181_asp-trp mutation for AFB1. All Mutations We Tested 14421 --> AFG1 & 186907 --> AFB1 Best mutations The top 4 results yielding mutations were mutated at the same time in laccase to test the effect cumulative effect of top 4 stabilizing and activity enhancing point mutations, but did not yield good results as the increase in binding energy observed after performing molecular docking of the Top-4_mutations_combined laccase with AFG1 and AFB1, hence multiple mutations were not further considered in this study.
