# Background
Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites of fungi that cause hepatotoxicity, teratogenicity, and immunotoxicity, and are classified as group I **carcinogens**.*Aflatoxins*(AFs) are a type of mycotoxin produced by fungal species such as Aspergillus flavus, and A. parasiticus.These commonly infect cereal crops, including wheat, tree nuts, maize, cotton, and peanuts, andcan pose serious threats to humans and animals by causing various complications such ashepatotoxicity, teratogenicity and immunotoxicity. The main aflatoxins are B1, B2, G1 and G2, and can be toxic to the body through inhalation, mucous membranes or skin,leading to an overactive inflammatory response Various methods such as physical strategies, chemical methods and biodegradation are applied to detoxify aflatoxin. However, many of the existing physical and chemical methods for the detoxification of aflatoxin from the contaminated food and feed are unprofitable for practical application due to loss of nutritional quality, safety concerns, environment pollution, limited efficiency and high marketing costs. In contrast, biological processes involving biodegradation and biosorption are more effective and promising strategies. Microbial and enzymatic applications are moderate, cheap  and effective with little to no harmful intermediates for humans and animals consumption.

Globally, **fungal laccase** have better pH/temperature stability, greater tolerance to metals, and can oxidize a wide variety of substrates of different origins. The use of laccase can lead to rapid and significant degradation of various substrates.

Our present study has aimed to analyze the interaction of AFB1 and AFG1 with the *site-directed mutated* laccase to find possible differences  and enhancement in enzyme and ligand pocket recognition towards various catalytic sites using different docking simulations and procedures.
